### 💬 Speaking Notes:

"A perceptron is like the smallest brain cell of an AI system. It takes input, applies weights, makes a decision, and passes the result."

### ⚙️ Flow:

Input ➝ Weighted Sum ➝ Activation ➝ Output

🎯 Example:

> Choosing a restaurant: You consider cost, distance, and rating. Each factor is an input that influences your decision.

---

## 🔁 Slide 9: Trial-and-Error Learning in ML

### 🎯 Objective:

* Show how machines improve by learning from outcomes.

### 💬 Speaking Notes:

"Just like humans learn from mistakes, machines do too. They try, fail, get feedback, adjust, and try again — that’s how they learn!"

🕹️ Example:
